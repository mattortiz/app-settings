## Using the files

Copy all (or selected) files in this folder to your Bunches folder and have at it.

I use these bunches and supporting files to create digital work spaces for different projects or modes. They are self-contained and they are provided as a convenience to others as I'm learning/using it. I provide no support, whatsoever.
