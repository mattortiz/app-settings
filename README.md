# app-settings by Matt Ortiz

## Documentation

This is it. ;)

## Using the files

I use a nuanced, but common set of productivity, creative, and product development tools, and I often times rebuild machines or share those settings.

This repo is a place for me to share those things with friends and anyone who may find them helpful.

I provide no support for any of the tools, settings, or apps—what so ever. Hope their helpful. ;)
